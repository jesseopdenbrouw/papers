	abstract = "A function for use in interpolating thermistor calibrations has been found which is suitable for use with a wide variety of thermistors for ranges of a few degrees to a few hundred degrees. It is Tâˆ’1 = A + B log R + C (log R)3 where T is the Kelvin temperature, R the resistance, and A, B and C constants. This function possesses a number of desirable properties and fits thermistor data considerably better than many such functions now in use."
